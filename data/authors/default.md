Hi :)

My name is Ynon Perek. I'm a full stack developer and I like to read code. And yes I know old the old claims for example that writing code is easier than reading it or that you should just use a module and not care what's inside. I don't buy them.

Reading the source code for libraries I use helps me understand them better and therefore use them better. And sometimes after reading the code I realize I don't want to use that library at all.

This blog is dedicated to my code reading hobby. In each post I'll read a snippet out loud so you can follow along. Let's dive in.
